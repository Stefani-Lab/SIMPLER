Matlab software implementation for SIMPLER (Supercritical Illumination Microscopy Photometric z-Localization with Enhanced Resolution)


===========================================================================
  
This software package includes several Matlab scripts and auxiliary
functions, which implement the computational algorithms for the method
SIMPLER described in the following publication:
 
Three-dimensional total-internal reflection fluorescence nanoscopy with nanometric axial resolution by photometric localization of single molecules.

Setup and Usage
===========================================================================
  
1) To use this software in GUI form, set the folder containing the software files as the current directory in Matlab and run:
run_SIMPLER
in Matlab's command window.
 
2) For a detailed description of the different operations available, please read the "Supplementary Software Documentation" .pdf file that is included within the .zip folder of the software.

3) For further details or to report bugs contact:
    a.szalai@cibion.conicet.gov.ar

4) This software (source code and GUI) has been developed in Matlab R2015a and tested in MatlabR2019b.

5) The folder containing this software also contains example data. The expected results with these files are described in the "Supplementary Software Documentation". This example data should be analyzed in <10 seconds in any "normal" desktop computer. Larger datasets can take longer (minutes or ~ hour, depending on the size of the data).
